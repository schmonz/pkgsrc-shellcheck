ShellSpec is a full-featured BDD unit testing framework for dash, bash,
ksh, zsh and all POSIX shells that provides first-class features such as
code coverage, mocking, parameterized test, parallel execution and more.
It was developed as a dev/test tool for cross-platform shell scripts and
shell script libraries. ShellSpec is a new modern testing framework
released in 2019, but it's already stable enough. With lots of practical
CLI features and simple yet powerful syntax, it provides you with a fun
shell script test environment.
